# ROADE

As the transport and logistics industry is currently under lots of pressure meeting deadlines due to drivers’ shortage all over Ireland and EU (European Union), this could be a solution that industry would welcome to help achieve their targets and meet customers’ expectations. 
Over the course of several years and recently since the start of pandemic many drivers left the industry and have no intention going back full time due to a variety of reasons. New potential drivers were delayed in obtaining the training and qualification needed for professional HGV drivers due to test centres being closed and training not being available because of Covid-19 restrictions. 

The app would allow both Employer and Drivers to connect. The companies could post job offers that are either long term or short term (temporary jobs or single day job). Drivers than can select offer based on their availability. The app will also allow companies to look for available drivers, meeting criteria needed for specific job. Once job was accepted and completed, both sides will be able to leave the review and rate score.
